    "\n",
    "Latent Semantic Analysis is a technique is Natural Language Processing of analyzing relationships between a set of documents and the terms they contain by producing a set of concepts related to the documents and terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSA finds this relationship by using a mathematical technique called Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD), which decomposes the document term matrix into three matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input A, a matrix where m is the number of documents and n is the number of terms. A will be decomposed into 3 matrices as below -\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A\\ = U\\sum V^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matrix U will be m*k matrix. The rows will be the documents and the columns will be concepts (or topics)\n",
    "- Matrix Sigma will be k*k diagonal matrix. The elements will be the amount of variation captured from each concept\n",
    "- Matrix V will be m*k (the transpose matrix). The rows will be the terms and columns will be the concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "SVD also reduces the dimensions significantly as the new concept space defined by eigen vectors is in sorted order, with first dimension defining the strongest concept dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like PCA, we need not use the entire matrix and can pick first k values which will define majority of the relationship between terms and documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why its called `Reduced SVD` or `Truncated SVD`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see how to implement this."
